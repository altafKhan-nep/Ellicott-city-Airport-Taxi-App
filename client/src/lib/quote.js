/**
 * Client-side fare ESTIMATE for the hero "Get a quick quote" widget.
 *
 * The formula mirrors `estimateFare()` in the server's rideService:
 *
 *   total = base + distanceKm * perKm + durationMin * perMin
 *
 * The rates are the server's own `FALLBACK_FARE` constant, not a number invented
 * for the client. Per-class pricing is deliberately NOT public (`GET /api/fleet`
 * omits `fare`), so the card quotes the standard baseline rate and says so — it
 * is an estimate for a distance, not a price for a chosen class. The server
 * recomputes the real fare from the routed trip and the selected class when the
 * ride is created, which is why the UI never presents this as a final price.
 *
 * If this rate is ever allowed to drift from the server, the fix is a public
 * estimate endpoint that owns the pricing — not a second copy of the numbers.
